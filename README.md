This folder contains the data and R code for generating the forestplot analytics graphs used in published paper.
To generate the graph, load selected R code in RStudio and run the R code to generate PDF graphs.



Description
----------
**Figure 2.**  Comparison of incident pancreatic cancer risk in patients with T2DM between propensity-score matched GLP-1RAs versus other anti-diabetes medications groups. Outcomes were followed for 5 years after the index event (the first prescription of GLP-1RA versus other anti-diabetes medication classes in 1/2010â€“4/2019) for both exposure and comparison groups. Hazard rates were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model with censoring applied. Overall risk = the number of patients with outcomes during the follow-up time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. A plus sign (+) indicates that a patient was prescribed GLP-1RA or a non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medication, while a minus sign (-) indicates that they were not. DPP-4i indicates dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors; SGLT2i, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors; SU, sulfonylureas; TZD, thiazolidinediones.
